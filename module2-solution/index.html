    <h3 class="sectionTitle sec3back">Legume</h3>
    <p class="sectionText">Legume Soup is a traditional Albanian red bean soup that has a variable recipe (and even name), depending on the region of the country. The preparation starts by soaking the red beans overnight, after which they are rinsed and boiled. Meanwhile, diced onions are fried in olive oil until golden-brown, to which tomato sauce, parsley, and some of the bean stock are added.<br/>
    Once the sauce has thickened, it is combined with the boiling beans.</p>
